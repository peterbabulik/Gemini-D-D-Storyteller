# Gemini D&D Storyteller

An immersive Dungeons & Dragons storytelling experience powered by Google Gemini. This application dynamically generates captivating fantasy stories, illustrates them with unique AI-generated images, and brings them to life with audible narration.

## üìñ Overview

Gemini D&D Storyteller is a web-based application that leverages the power of Google's Gemini models to create a rich, interactive storytelling experience. Users are presented with an unfolding narrative, accompanied by vivid imagery and spoken-word audio, all generated in real-time. The project showcases a seamless integration of text, image, and audio generation from a single AI source.

This entire application was developed using a "vibe coding" approach within [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com), relying heavily on AI to generate the necessary code and bring the concept to life.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Dynamic Story Generation:** The core of the application is a story that is dynamically generated by Google Gemini. Each turn of the narrative is crafted to create an engaging and unpredictable adventure.
*   **AI-Generated Imagery:** Every scene in the story is accompanied by a unique, AI-generated image that visually represents the narrative, providing a rich, multi-modal experience.
*   **Text-to-Speech Narration:** The application uses Google Gemini's text-to-speech capabilities to provide an audio narration of the story, further immersing the user in the D&D world.
*   **Interactive Progression:** Users can progress through the story at their own pace by clicking the "NEXT TURN" button, revealing the next part of the adventure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

While the project was "vibe coded," the underlying technology appears to be:

*   **Frontend:** A modern web framework, React.
*   **AI Integration:** The application is deeply connected to the Google Gemini "framework" for its core functionalities:
    *   **Story & Text:** Gemini API for text generation.
    *   **Images:** Gemini API for image generation.
    *   **Speech:** Gemini API for text-to-speech synthesis.
*   **Development Environment:** The application was primarily developed within [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com).

## üöÄ How It Works

The application's workflow is centered around its interaction with the Google Gemini API, as evidenced by service and hook files like `geminiService.ts` and `useSpeech.ts`:

1.  **Story Prompt:** An initial prompt is sent to the Gemini API to begin the D&D narrative.
2.  **Text Generation:** Gemini generates a portion of the story, which is then displayed to the user.
3.  **Image Generation:** Based on the generated text, a prompt is sent to the Gemini image generation model to create a relevant illustration.
4.  **Speech Synthesis:** The generated text is also passed to Gemini's text-to-speech service. The application receives the audio data, decodes it, and plays it back to the user.
5.  **User Progression:** The user clicks "NEXT TURN" to prompt the generation of the next story segment, image, and audio narration, continuing the adventure.

## üí° The "Vibe Coded" Approach

This project is a testament to the power of AI-assisted development. The term "vibe coded" refers to a development process where the programmer guides a generative AI model (in this case, likely within Google AI Studio) to produce the source code, focusing on the high-level goals and "vibes" of the application rather than writing every line of code manually. This approach allowed for the rapid prototyping and development of a complex, multi-modal AI application.
